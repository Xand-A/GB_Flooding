### *Note that as of last run (12/07/24) - there were no flood warnings in GB*

## What
Activate 'flood warnings' in GB

Repo tracking activate flood warnings of GB nations from each respective EA's provisions

* Enviromental Agency (EA) - England
* NRW - Wales
* SEPA - Scotland

*Note that N.Ireland's EA doesn't provide data in a similar way so not avaliable*

## How

Using API calls from EA and NRW to extract flood warnings, SEPA provision is different so uses web scraping

## Next steps
Add in points of interest which can be found within flooding zones
